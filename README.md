### DVD ScreenSaver (JavaFX)
Created by Azuras (aka Nicolas R.)

## _Features_ :
- Extend and shrink the Cube
- Dynamic resizing of the window during execution
- Pleasing-looking effect when the cube touches the corners (not pleasant for epileptic people)
- Cheat codes (if you're a developer, you'll find them 😉)
- ... and more! (*not really, but nvm*)

## _How to use_ :
- Download the latest release (.jar file)
- Be sure to have at least Java 11 installed
- Run the .jar file
- Enjoy!

## _Commands_ :
- `UP` & `DOWN` : Increase the size of the cube
- `LEFT` & `RIGHT` : Decrease the size of the cube
- `TAB` : Shows the main commands again on screen
- `ECHAP` : Reset the cube to its original speed and size (in case you've bumped into a corner, or you activated cheat codes)
- `SOME WORDS` : Type words that come in your mind, and see what happens! (maybe you'll find something interesting 🙃)

## _Cheat codes_ :
- Well no why would I 🤣
- Okay, okay, here is one for you : `smol` - This will make the cube 2 times smaller than its current size
- That's all you'll get for me ! ... yet 😝
